# Customer_Segmentation
# in the past week, i worked on this project, the company wanted to know how to classify their customer based on their spending score.
# i used Exploratory data analysis to analyse the data, visualize the data then use unsupervised maching learning model to train the data. 
# the model suggested using five clusters 
# the model concluded that the company have 5 classes of customers based on their spending pattern.
# this insight enabled the cpmany to derive a conclusion on the type of personalized adertisement awareness they will create on each of thier customer segments
